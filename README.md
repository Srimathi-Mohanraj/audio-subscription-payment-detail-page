# Audio Subscription Payment Details Web Page

This project is a fully responsive audio subscription payment details page created using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The goal of the page is to provide users with a seamless and intuitive interface for managing and entering their payment details for audio subscription services. 

The layout is carefully crafted using Flexbox to ensure flexibility and adaptability across different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly and user-centric. The form elements are neatly organized to give a clear, minimalistic view while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing design. The use of Flexbox allows the page to maintain a fluid, flexible structure, offering consistent alignment and spacing for optimal readability and ease of use on devices ranging from mobile phones to desktops.

Key features:
- **Responsive Design:** The page adjusts automatically to fit various screen sizes, ensuring that it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clean and Modern UI:** A user-friendly, minimalistic design that focuses on usability and clarity, making the payment process as straightforward as possible.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Flexbox is used to create a flexible grid layout, ensuring consistent alignment and spacing of the content across different screen sizes.
- **Smooth User Experience:** The page is designed to guide users through entering their payment details with a simple and efficient flow.

This project demonstrates my ability to build functional and responsive web pages using core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and Flexbox) while focusing on user experience and design aesthetics.
